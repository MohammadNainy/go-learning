# Go Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey of learning the Go programming language —  
from basic syntax and simple programs to more structured exercises and small projects.

## 🧩 Learning Stages

### Stage 1 — Getting Started
Learned how to set up the Go environment, initialize a project, and run a simple “Hello World” program.

### Stage 2 — Variables & Time Formatting
Practiced declaring and using variables, reading user input, formatting strings, and displaying the current system time.

### Stage 3 — Conditions & Loops
Implemented logic using `if` statements and `for` loops to process multiple user inputs and control program flow.

### Stage 4 — Functions & Slices
Combined loops, conditions, and reusable functions.  
Used slices to dynamically store user inputs and calculate both average and maximum values.
