# Go Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal journey of learning the Go programming language —  
from basic syntax and simple programs to more structured exercises and small projects.

## 🧩 Learning Stages

### Stage 1 — Getting Started
Learned how to set up the Go environment, initialize a project, and run a simple “Hello World” program.

### Stage 2 — Variables & Time Formatting
Practiced declaring and using variables, reading user input, formatting strings, and displaying the current system time.

### Stage 3 — Conditions & Loops
Implemented logic using `if` statements and `for` loops to process multiple user inputs and control program flow.

### Stage 4 — Functions & Slices
Combined loops, conditions, and reusable functions.  
Used slices to dynamically store user inputs and calculate both average and maximum values.

### Stage 5 — File Handling
Learned how to create, open, and append data to text files using the `os` and `bufio` packages.  
Built a simple Notes App that saves user input to a file and displays all saved notes at the end.

### Stage 6 — Structs & Methods
Learned how to define custom data types using `struct` and attach methods to them.  
Built a simple Student Manager program that stores, displays, and updates student information using methods with both value and pointer receivers.

### Stage 7 — Slices of Structs
Managed a list of `Student` records using slices.  
Implemented functions to add, find, and remove students,  
as well as to calculate maximum and average grades.  
Practiced struct iteration, conditional logic, and slice manipulation in Go.
