# Learning Log

## Stage 1 — Getting Started (2025-10-05)
- Installed and configured the Go environment  
- Verified setup using `go version`  
- Created base folders: `Basic/` and `Projects/`  
- Initialized module using `go mod init`  
- Wrote the first Go program (`Hello, World!`) using `fmt.Println`  
- Created documentation files (`README.md`, `LEARNING_LOG.md`, `.gitignore`)  

---

## Stage 2 — Variables & Time Formatting (2025-10-06)
- Practiced variable declaration with `var` and shorthand `:=`  
- Collected user input using `fmt.Scanln`  
- Used `fmt.Printf` for formatted string output  
- Retrieved and formatted current time with `time.Now().Format()`  
- Added inline code comments following Go documentation conventions  

---

## Stage 3 — Conditions & Loops (2025-10-07)
- Learned to control program flow using `if` and `else` statements  
- Implemented repetitive input with an infinite `for` loop  
- Used `break` to terminate user input when a negative number was entered  
- Calculated the total sum of all positive inputs  
- Enhanced user interaction and program clarity through clear console output  

---

## Stage 4 — Functions & Slices (2025-10-08)
- Used `slice` to dynamically store user input values  
- Implemented `append()` for adding items to slices  
- Defined custom functions to calculate average and maximum values  
- Utilized the new `slices` package (`slices.Max()`) for simplicity  
- Practiced handling empty input cases to prevent runtime errors  
- Improved modular design and readability through function separation
